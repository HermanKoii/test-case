## MCP Integration Testing

### Overview
The Master Control Program (MCP) Integration Testing is a critical component of our testing strategy, designed to ensure comprehensive validation of system interactions and functionality.

### Testing Methodology
- **Purpose**: Validate complex system integrations and interactions
- **Scope**: End-to-end testing of critical system components
- **Approach**: Simulated environment testing with comprehensive scenario coverage

### Key Testing Principles
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all major system integration points
2. **Isolation**: Ensure tests can run independently
3. **Reproducibility**: Consistent and repeatable test scenarios

### Test Categories
- **Functional Integration Tests**
- **Performance Integration Tests**
- **Error Handling and Recovery Tests**

### Test Coverage
Integration tests cover critical paths, including:
- Data flow between services
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Complex transaction processing
- Component interaction validation
- System resilience under various conditions

### Running Integration Tests
To run MCP integration tests, use the following command:
```bash
npm run test:integration
```

### Best Practices
- Use mock services for external dependencies
- Implement robust error tracking
- Maintain detailed test logs
- Regularly update test scenarios
- Maintain test isolation
- Use realistic test data

### Reporting
Integration test results are automatically logged and can be reviewed in the system's test management dashboard.

### Limitations
Some integration tests may require:
- Specific environmental setups
- Controlled resource access
- Advanced configuration
