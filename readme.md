# Project Documentation

## Overview
This project includes robust testing infrastructure with a focus on comprehensive integration testing.

## MCP Integration Testing

### Purpose
The Master Control Program (MCP) Integration Testing ensures seamless interaction between different system components, validating the reliability and performance of our core systems.

### Testing Approach
Our MCP integration tests are designed to:
- Verify end-to-end system interactions
- Validate complex workflow scenarios
- Ensure system resilience under various conditions

### Key Testing Strategies
- **Component Interaction**: Validate communication between different system modules
- **Error Handling**: Test system behavior under unexpected conditions
- **Performance Verification**: Measure system response times and resource utilization

### Test Coverage
Integration tests cover critical paths, including:
- Data flow between services
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Complex transaction processing

### Running Integration Tests
To run MCP integration tests, use the following command:
```bash
npm run test:integration
```

### Best Practices
- Maintain test isolation
- Use realistic test data
- Continuously update test scenarios
