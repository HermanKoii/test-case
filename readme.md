## MCP Integration Testing

### Overview
The Master Control Program (MCP) integration testing framework is a critical component of our project's quality assurance process. This section provides detailed insights into our approach to integration testing.

### Testing Strategy
- **Purpose**: Validate system-wide interactions and component integration
- **Scope**: Comprehensive testing of MCP-related functionality
- **Methodology**: 
  - Automated integration test suites
  - Comprehensive coverage of critical system pathways
  - Simulation of complex interaction scenarios

### Key Testing Principles
1. **Isolation**: Ensure individual components work correctly in isolation
2. **Interaction**: Validate seamless communication between system components
3. **Error Handling**: Rigorous testing of edge cases and potential failure modes

### Test Coverage
- System-level integration points
- Cross-component communication
- Performance and reliability validation

### Running Integration Tests
```bash
# Execute MCP integration test suite
npm run test:integration
```

### Best Practices
- Always run full test suite before code commits
- Monitor test coverage metrics
- Continuously refine test scenarios

### Troubleshooting
- Refer to test logs for detailed error diagnostics
- Contact the QA team for complex integration issues
