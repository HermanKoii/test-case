## MCP Integration Testing

### Overview
The Master Control Program (MCP) Integration Testing is a critical component of our testing strategy, designed to ensure comprehensive validation of system interactions and functionality.

### Testing Methodology
- **Purpose**: Validate complex system integrations and interactions
- **Scope**: End-to-end testing of critical system components
- **Approach**: Simulated environment testing with comprehensive scenario coverage

### Key Testing Principles
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all major system integration points
2. **Isolation**: Ensure tests can run independently
3. **Reproducibility**: Consistent and repeatable test scenarios

### Test Categories
- **Functional Integration Tests**
- **Performance Integration Tests**
- **Error Handling and Recovery Tests**

### Component Interaction Strategies
- Verify communication between different system modules
- Test system behavior under unexpected conditions
- Measure system response times and resource utilization

### Test Coverage
Integration tests cover critical paths, including:
- Data flow between services
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Complex transaction processing

### Running Integration Tests
```bash
# Execute MCP integration test suite
npm run test:integration
```

### Best Practices
- Use mock services for external dependencies
- Implement robust error tracking
- Maintain detailed test logs
- Regularly update test scenarios
- Always run full test suite before code commits
- Monitor test coverage metrics

### Troubleshooting
- Refer to test logs for detailed error diagnostics
- Contact the QA team for complex integration issues

### Reporting
Integration test results are automatically logged and can be reviewed in the system's test management dashboard.

### Limitations
Some integration tests may require:
- Specific environmental setups
- Controlled resource access
- Advanced configuration
