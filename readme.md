# Project Overview

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage and Approach

Our project employs a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure code quality, reliability, and maintainability. We utilize multiple testing methodologies to validate the functionality, performance, and robustness of our codebase.

#### Current Testing Frameworks
- Unit Testing: Designed to validate individual components and functions in isolation
- Integration Testing: Ensures different modules and systems work correctly together
- (Future) End-to-End Testing: Planned for complete system validation

#### Testing Goals
- Maintain high code coverage
- Catch and prevent regressions
- Ensure consistent and predictable software behavior
- Facilitate continuous integration and deployment

#### Running Tests
To run the project's test suite, use the following command:
```bash
npm test  # or appropriate test command for your project
```

#### Contributing to Testing
We welcome contributions to our test suite. When adding new features or fixing bugs, please:
1. Write comprehensive unit tests
2. Ensure all existing tests pass
3. Maintain or improve overall test coverage

*Note: Our testing approach is iterative and continuously evolving.*
