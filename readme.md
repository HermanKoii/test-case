# Project Server Integration Guide

## Server Overview
This project provides a robust server setup with comprehensive integration capabilities. The server is designed to facilitate seamless connections and provide a flexible API interface.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the server, ensure you have the following requirements:

- Node.js (v16.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v8.0.0 or higher)
- A stable internet connection
- Basic understanding of RESTful API concepts

## Server Setup

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-project.git
cd your-project
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following configuration:
```
SERVER_PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdb
API_SECRET=your_secret_key
```

### Running the Server

Start the server in different modes:

#### Development Mode
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

#### Production Mode
```bash
npm run start:prod
```

## Connection Methods

### Local Connection
To connect to the local server:
- Base URL: `http://localhost:3000`
- Default Port: 3000

### Remote Connection
For remote server connections, replace `localhost` with your server's domain or IP address.

## Connection Authentication

### API Key Authentication
- Include your API key in the request header:
```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Token-Based Authentication
1. Obtain an authentication token via the `/auth/token` endpoint
2. Include the token in subsequent requests

## Common Connection Scenarios

### Handling Connection Errors
- Ensure firewall settings allow traffic on the specified port
- Verify network connectivity
- Check server status and availability

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Port Already in Use**
   - Stop other processes using port 3000
   - Change the port in the configuration

2. **Dependency Installation Failures**
   - Verify Node.js and npm versions
   - Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
   - Reinstall dependencies

## Security Recommendations
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Rotate API keys and tokens regularly
- Implement rate limiting
- Use environment-specific configurations
